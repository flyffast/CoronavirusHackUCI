This program is to allow users to register their phone number into our system so that they can be alerted when there are confirmed
cases of the coronavirus.

Using Twilio's API and Google Cloud API we are able to search for keywords to find the confirmed cases and find the location of
the registerd phones. When we do find one we text the user the location that was confirmed and how far it is, in miles, away from them.

Texting:
Use #0 for our command prompt
#1 for how many confirmed cases are there in the US
#2 CDC website about the Coronavirus
#3 WHO Tweet's about Coronavirus
#4-#9 are Easter Eggs
